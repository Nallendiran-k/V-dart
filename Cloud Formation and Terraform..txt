Cloud Formation-Application Engg-IAAC
______________________________________

IAAC -Infrastructure as a Code.

In real time we have use 100 server in oraganization.If we want confire and integration in server it will take 
3-6 Days.If we want code deploy in all server it will take more time.So that we need automation.

Developer Friendly Service.

Code (Jason , Yaml)--->Cloud Engineering.

Time, cost , Effort --->Devops

In devops terraform.--Is a open source tool.

Management and governance -->Cloud foramtion.
 
or else we can use terraform

Terraform ---Configuration automation

What is conficuration automation

--Confircuration-Install/Start/RUN
--Automation? Automatic -No manual Intervention
IAAC-Infrastructe as a code 

same like cloud formation

Stack-Emvironment If run script it will automatically create an instance.

APP-Server /Storage/Network/Database/Loadbalncer/Username and password/AS.

AWS-EC2/S3/VPC/ROUTE53/RDS/ELB/IAM/ASG-- Developer create a code for this it will create a environment.

WE CAN USE ANSIBLE AND TERRAFORM.

Ansible application configuration.
